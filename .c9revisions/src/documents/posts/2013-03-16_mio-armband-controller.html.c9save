The product is still in development, with first units scheduled for release in late 2013, and demo videos reflect more of the makers vision than actual capabilities.<br>\nWhile it's easy to envision the possibilities this scenario opens, it is also interesting to think about potential drawbacks that wearable controllers would imply. The very first thing that comes to mind is preventing unwanted input: MYO will feature a unique gesture to be turned on and off. However, considering how many sudden activities we perform with our arms, a smart way to differentiate between input and noise will be key to the success of such devices. </p>"]],"start1":600,"start2":600,"length1":8,"length2":1272}]],"length":1872,"saved":false}
