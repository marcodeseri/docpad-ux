First of all, the interface gets rid of tabs: removing the chrome makes the browsing experience more immersive. Second, they introduce a couple of layered controls, for the back button and for other functions (like tab management).<br>\nThe video is a little long and is not a polished product presentation, but is worth watching.<br>\nMozilla's approach is obviously not the only attempt at building more immersive browsing experiences: <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dolphin-browser-for-ipad/id460812023?mt=8\">Dolphin HD</a> - among others - implements full screen browsing in a nice way, with gestures and spatial controls (swipe left and right to reveal interface elements).</p>\n<!--more--> \n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1246}]],"length":1246}
