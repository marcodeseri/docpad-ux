<p>OpenHallway is a simple remote usability testing tool: you create a test scenario, share the link for it, and record user activity performing the task.<br>
While the output is very rich - you get to see a video of the session, even with audio if the user has a microphone available - the process is not the most straightforward you will find: java is required to record sessions and the user has to manually start and stop recording.<br><a href="http://www.openhallway.com">OpenHallway</a> offers a free account - recordings are limited to only 10 minutes - to try out the service.</p><p><a href="http://www.verifyapp.com">Verify</a> is a powerful tool to get early feedback on design from real people around the world. Key features are the ability to share tests with your customers, using twitter and facebook, and clear visual reports.</p>
