<p>OpenHallway is a simple remote usability testing tool: you create a test scenario, share the link for it, and record user activity performing the task.<br>
While the output is very rich - you get to see a video of the session, even with audio if the user has a microphone available - the process is not the most straightforward you will find: java is required to record sessions and the user has to manually start and stop recording.<br><a href="http://www.openhallway.com">OpenHallway</a> offers a free account - recordings are limited to only 10 minutes - to try out the service.</p>
