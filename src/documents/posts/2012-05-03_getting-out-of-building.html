<p>Google's Tomer Sharon has some precious hints on <strong>how to approach user research</strong>. <br></p>
<p>The 25 minutes talk is rich in useful suggestions, some of which are not as commonly accepted as they should be. One of my favorite parts is the "if you are spending $50,000 on a pre-launch usability test you are probably doing it wrong" quote. <strong>User research doesn't require fancy budgets </strong> - and most of the time fancy budgets subtract value from user research instead of adding it. </p>
<p>Tomer talks about simple techniques you can use for your research, with the goal to get out of the building and see things from the perspective of your users. Throughout your journey, one of the key aspects will be getting buy-in for your research. And key will be making the whole team part of the research: it's the best way for everyone to understand the value of it and participate in making a better product.</p>
