<p>Gesture based interfaces look very attractive: they need a minimum amount of on-screen objects, often resulting in uncluttered interfaces.<br>
The down side is that they are much harder to use in every day life than they look on presentation videos.

<p>Still, there are a couple of concepts I really like, because they fit with the way I deal with my email:
<ul><li>immediately <strong>actionable message feed</strong>: mails are treated like a todo list. I usually accomplish this setup marking as unread the mails I need to act on, while forgetting about all the others. Mailbox's interface is perfectly suited to this kind of use, even letting you reorder the message stream</li>
<li><strong>message snoozing</strong>: this is something I really miss in my current mail clients, and I can see myself using this feature a lot.</li>
</ul>
