<p><a href="http://globalmoxie.com">Josh Clark</a> - in an already classic speech from <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/">webstock</a> 11 - makes it clear how buttons work as a middle man between the user and the content.<br> While buttons used to be a good metaphor with desktop PCs, touch based interfaces changed everything. Touch interfaces establish a new level of intimacy with the content, and designers should leverage this factor when building interfaces. At this new level of intimacy, visual feedback - like fast animations - can help build intimacy and explain the metaphor the designer chose. <br><br>
On touch interfaces, where Fitts law doesn't apply anymore, gestures - especially multi-touch on bigger screens - configure themselves as the new keyboard shortcuts.</p>
