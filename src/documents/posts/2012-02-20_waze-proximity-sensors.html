<p>Smartphones use many different sensors to make the device more aware of the context. Proximity sensors are often used to put the display in a sleep state, to preserve battery life. Waze does something different: it leverages the proximity sensor as a trigger for voice commands, when hands must stay where they are most needed.</p>
