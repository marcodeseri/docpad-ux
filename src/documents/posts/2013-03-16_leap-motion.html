<p>Are gestures interfaces ready for prime time? We will find out in May, when Leap Motion launches.</p>
<!--more--> 
<p><a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> is set to bridge the gap between camera-based controllers (like Kinect) and touchscreens: it is a tiny device that senses how you move your hands and fingers and lets you control your pc or Mac.<br>
The device will start shipping in May - with developers already at work on the first units - and then we wil see if gestures are ready for prime time. Touchscreens on traditional desktop pcs have failed so far: the interaction feels unnatural and strain is a major issue when you spend long hours in front of a computer.</p>
