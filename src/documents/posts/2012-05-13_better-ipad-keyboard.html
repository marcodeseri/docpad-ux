<p>The Ipad has been considered a consumption device since its launch in 2010, but things are slowing starting to change. New apps are redefining what can be done on a tablet - iPhoto being one of the best examples in this area. From a UX point of view, gestures are enabling a powerful paradigm shift.<br>
One of the missing pieces is still a better typing experience. There is something promising on the horizon, as this video shows us how a simple tweak could <strong>greatly increase software keyboard usability</strong>.<br>
The idea is simple: swiping with one or two fingers on the keyboard lets you move the cursor, consequently speeding up text editing. Combining this simple gesture with the shift key also improves the text selection experience.<br>
This technique is known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooper_Selection"><strong>Hooper Selection</strong></a>, after the name of the Georgia Tech student who conceived it.<br>
In a few weeks several implementations came to life and jailbreakers can try SwipeSelection on Cydia right now. I really think this is a better way of dealing with text on tablet devices and hope the feature will see the light in future versions of iOS.</p>
