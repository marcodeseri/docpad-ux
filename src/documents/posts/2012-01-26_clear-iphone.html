<p>The app store is full of to-do apps, but Clear is different. Its UI has many interesting intuitions and looks fresh and inspired.<br>
While early touch based interfaces relied heavily on buttons, new <strong>concepts surface exploring the power of gestures</strong>.<br>
Gestures are not the only answer to interface challenges, but they are surely underused.<br>
It is important to remember that serious <strong>drawbacks do exist</strong>: first and foremost, gestures require learning to get accustomed to. Also, some gestures potentially overlap with other system features (iPhone's swipe to delete comes to mind, as it overlaps with the rampant use of horizontal sliding card metaphor that Twitter for iPad made famous).</p>
<p>Still, I think gestures are a powerful way to let users explore and manipulate the space of an app. And <a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/">Clear</a> shows interesting new interactions.</p>
