<p>Everyone is talking about wearable devices, but in most cases it's hard to find a real value in those products. Nymi could change that. It's a simple idea that solves one of the fundamental problems about the internet: password based authentication. Let your heart do the work for you.</p>

<p>While I think it's difficult for nymi to succeed on a broad market, I expect big players like Apple and Google to go in this direction. Providing biometric authentication at the OS level is key to truly eradicate passwords.</p>
<p>This is exactly what should be at the core of an iWatch: a system that knows exactly who you are and securely shares that information with your smartphone.</p>
