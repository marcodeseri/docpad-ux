<p>MYO armband promises to make sci-fi scenarios come true, using both your arms movements and electrical activity from your muscles to engage with digital interfaces.</p>

<p>The mouse is slowing fading away as the de facto standard in interacting with digital interfaces. Gestures are taking over and there is incredible innovation to be seen in this field.<br>
Touch screens ignited the revolution, then new approaches started to surface in late 2012. <a href="/ui/leap-motion">Leap Motion</a> found a smart way to bridge the gap between Microsoft's Kinect and touchscreens, in a way that elegantly works also for the good old pcs.<br><a href="https://getmyo.com/">MYO armband</a> tries to push this concept to the next level: <strong>the user actually wears the controller, hands-free</strong>. The product is still in development, with first units scheduled for release in late 2013, and demo videos reflect more of the makers vision than actual capabilities.<br>
While it's easy to envision the possibilities this scenario opens, it is also interesting to think about potential drawbacks that wearable controllers would imply. The very first thing that comes to mind is preventing unwanted input: MYO will feature a unique gesture to be turned on and off. However, considering how many sudden activities we perform with our arms, a smart way to differentiate between input and noise will be key to the success of such devices. </p>
